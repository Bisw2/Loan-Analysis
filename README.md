This is my first project being an intern.
THe task was given to us that to find out the flaws in the system ,gives an overview and how can they improve.

After data cleaning , data modeling , we starts our work on building visulas then dshboards.
By use of data mining we found out their systems have 2-3 faults and their current on going loans are comes near to an end.
a lot of charged off ,not verified payments are their .

Til now they are may be fine but after 1 year their all loans should have sucessfully completed then issue will rise
